# Androidlater
The free and easy way to localize your android app

(Please note this utility is in alpha and as such may have some quirks)

# Description
This project was born from the difficult and time consuming process of localizing ones android application for many different languages.

It is 100% free and uses google translate to translate strings, currently no api key is required for its usage.

This project will take all of your strings and translate them into every single language that google translate supports.
It will then go and place them in the proper resource folders where you can edit them to fix up any mistakes google translate may have made.
Its a great way to quick start the translation process.

Although google translate is not perfect this project takes alot of the grunt work out of the process.

# Usage
To use download the jar file that is located in the out/artifacts folder of this repo

Place the jar file in the res directory of your android project.

Then navigate to the res folder in terminal / command prompt and run "java -jar Androidlater.jar"

Then just watch the programs output until its done and viola, you have your string resources translated into multiple languages.

Enjoy!!!!!!
